This is a simple calendar widget for wordpress. All it does is print the calendar. The epiphany for me in working on this widget was realizing that all you need to know to print out a month accurately is how many days are in the month, and what day of the week the month starts from. All of this information is readily available in php's date function.

You can add this calendar to your website through the widgets page in the admin section of wordpress.
